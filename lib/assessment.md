## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the interaction in terms of clients and servers.
<!-- the web faciliated the communication between clients and servers.  For example when you access a webpage, you are using the web to create a copy of the webpage from a server to your browswer or computer.  If you have another users looking the same page in their browser/computer, the two of you are looking at different copy rather than the same file. -->

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.
