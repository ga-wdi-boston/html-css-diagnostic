This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

##### For HTML
    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

##### For CSS
    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the interaction in terms of clients and servers.
<!-- your answer starts here -->
The web is a service because it is a system of entities requesting and sending information to each other. A wonderful real-world corollary to this is Netflix (the old kind with DVD's). A person (the client) sends a request to Netflix (the server) for a DVD (some information), and Netflix sends that DVD to the client. The web works the same way, with clients (browsers) requesting information from servers (websites) and in turn those servers sending the requested information to the client.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.
<!-- your answer starts here -->
```HTML
<html>
  <body>
    <header>Title</header>
    <ul>
      <li>Thing 1</li>
      <li>Thing 2</li>
      <li>Thing 3</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

What selectors could we write to reference each of the following categories of elements?
* All elements that belong to the class `big`
* The element matching ID `contentPane`
* Any elements that belong both to the `important` and `red` classes
* Any `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
```CSS
.big{
}
#contentPane{
}
.important.red{
}
div p{
}
```
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values will the div labelled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
</head>
  <div class="things">
    <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
      Blah blah blah.
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```

**main.css**
```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
specialDiv will have a font-family of cursive because it's an inline style attribute
it's text color will be yellow because in the CSS code, the color assigned to .specialDiv has greater specificity than that of div
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 5

Order the following parts of the box model from 'innermost' to 'outermost'.
* content
* border
* margin
* padding

<!-- your answer starts here -->
content << padding << border << margin
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger than the dimensions of any of the `divs` given below, how will they be arranged on the page?

**index.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="divOne"></div>
  <div class="divTwo"></div>
  <div class="divThree"></div>
  <div class="divFour"></div>
  <div class="divFive"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

**style.css**
```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divOne will be at the top of right of the page
divs Two, Three, and Five will be arranged in a row from right to left, next to
divOne
divFour will sit below the row with divs Two, Three, and Five
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 7

Consider the following media queries. How wide would the screen need to be for elements with the class `stretch` to have a width of 150 pixels?
```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
stretch elements would be 150px wide when the window is 600 px wide
400<600<800 so stretch elements would be 25% the width of the window
600 * 0.25 = 150
