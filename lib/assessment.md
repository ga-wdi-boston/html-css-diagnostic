This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

##### For HTML
    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

##### For CSS
    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the interaction in terms of clients and servers.
<!-- your answer ends here -->
The web is a service where the web page is the service offered. The page is a document
which is delivered to the client. The web is NOT the cables and wires which deliver
the service.

The client in this case is the web browser. The document is delivered to the web
browser and interpretted by it in order to render it for the user.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.
<!-- your answer starts here -->
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example HTML Code</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Item One</li>
      <li>Item Two</li>
      <li>Item Three</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 3

What selectors could we write to reference each of the following categories of elements?
* All elements that belong to the class `big`
* The element matching ID `contentPane`
* Any elements that belong both to the `important` and `red` classes
* Any `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
* .big  {}
* #contentPane {}
* .important.red {}
* div > p {}
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values will the div labelled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
</head>
  <div class="things">
    <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
      Blah blah blah.
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```

**main.css**
```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
The div labeled 'specialDiv' will have a text color of yellow (because it has the
highest specificity score of the divs defining the text color) and a font-family
of 'cursive' (because it is defined in-line).

Note that cascading won't occur between .things and .specialDiv because their
specificity is not equivalent, so .specialDiv's color value will prevail even
though .things appears later in the style sheet.

## Question 5

* content
* border

<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger than the dimensions of any of the `divs` given below, how will they be arranged on the page?

**index.html**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="divOne"></div>
  <div class="divTwo"></div>
  <div class="divThree"></div>
  <div class="divFour"></div>
  <div class="divFive"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

**style.css**
```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
[divTwo][divThree]                  [divOne]
[divFour][divFive]
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 7

Consider the following media queries. How wide would the screen need to be for elements with the class `stretch` to have a width of 150 pixels?
```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
600px
