# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
  ```HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>PAGE TITLE GOES HERE</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <ul>
        <li>LIST ITEM 1 GOES HERE</li>
        <li>LIST ITEM 2 GOES HERE</li>
        <li>LIST ITEM 3 GOES HERE</li>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 2

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
  '.big' =  _class_ `big`
  '#contentPane' = _ID_ `contentPane`
  '.important.red' =  `important` and `red` _classes_
  'div p' = `p` elements whose parents are `div`s
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="things">
      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
In 'specialDiv':
  text color = yellow
  font-family = cursive
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 4

Order the following parts of the _box model_ from **'innermost'** to
**'outermost'**.

content, border, margin, padding

<!-- your answer starts here -->
  content > padding > border > margin
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 5

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="divOne"></div>
    <div class="divTwo"></div>
    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divTwo and divThree are floated left and pinned to the left side of the first row.
divOne is floated right and pinned to the right side of the first row.
divFour is cleared, so it wraps onto the second row and appears at the left edge, followed by divFive
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following media queries. How wide, in `px`, would an element
with the class `.stretch` be at a _screen width_ of 550px?

```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
The width of an element with a class of '.stretch' would be 137.5px (rounded to 138).

Since the screen width of 550px is less than 800px, the media query for a min-width of 400px is used, specifying a width of 25% of 550px.
