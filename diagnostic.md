# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

<!-- your answer starts here -->

```
Clients send requests for resources on the web to servers, which send back
responses containing those resources (or an error code, if applicable). The
service the web provices is the set of available resources/information, the
links between those resources, and the methods for accessing and sharing those
resources.
```
