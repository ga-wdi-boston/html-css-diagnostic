# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

<!-- your answer starts here -->

HTTP protocol is what defines the relationship between clients and servers, and
since the web is built on HTTP protocol, that's why we call the web a "service"

Clients, such as browsers, send requests for information/responses to remote
web servers via the URL, and the servers then receive the request and send a response
back to the client. This is pretty much the foundation of how the web works!
(At least as far as I understand it!)

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Basic Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2 </li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
```CSS
  - .big { property: value; }
  - #contentPane { property: value; }
  - .important .red {property: value; }
  - div p {property: value; }
```

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="things">
      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
The div with the class specialDiv will have the color yellow and the font-family
cursive.

**'outermost'**.

<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="divOne"></div>
    <div class="divTwo"></div>
    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
All the divs will be stacked from left to right, except for divOne, which
will float to the right, and divFour, which will be on the left-most side
of the second row, since it is set to 'clear' div Three.
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 7

Consider the following media queries. How wide, in `px`, would an element
with the class `.stretch` be at a _screen width_ of 550px?

```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->

25%
