# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Javascript Hurts My Brain</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> Reasons Why Javascript Makes my Head Hurt </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>It's hard as shit</li>
      <li>It's hard as shit</li>
      <li>It's hard as shit</li>
    </ul>

  </body>
</html>

## Question 2

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

.big{
  style: value;
}

#contentPane {
  style: value;
}

.important, .red {
  style: value;
}

div p {
  style: value;
}

      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**
