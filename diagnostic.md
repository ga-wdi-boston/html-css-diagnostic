# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
The web functions because of informational transactions that happen between two different classes of systems - clients and servers.  Clients make requests to servers in the form of asking them to either retrieve, create, modify, or delete data.  A server responds to these requests by either approving them and executing, returning an error if either the client or server made a mistake, or denying the request, i.e., if the client doesn't have access, or if the file doesn't exist. As long as these functions are able to be done between clients and servers, you can have an internet.  It is not some static thing that exists only in one place, but rather it is the conversation.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

```HTML
<DOCTYPE!>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>
      </title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <ul>
        <li> </li>
        <li> </li>
        <li> </li>A
      </ul>
    </body>

## Question 3

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="divOne"></div>
    <div class="divTwo"></div>
    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divOne will be on top, at the right of the window.
divTwo will be on top at the left of the window.
divThree will be on top of divTwo on the top-left of the window.
divFour will be on the bottom of divOne and divTwo on the left of the window.

  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```
