# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

<!-- your answer starts here -->

You mean that the "web" takes the requests of clients and serves the data being
asked for.  A client (browser/app/computer) sends a request to a server using
a protocol with what is usually a very simple request, "send me this file."  The
server finds the data and sends it back with a simple protocol saying, "here you
go."

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
```html
  <!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <HTML>
    <head>
      <title = "mywebpage">
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>Great website, wow.
      </p>
    </body>
  </HTML>
```

## Question 3

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->

-  .big
-  #contentPane
-  .important .red
-  div > p

<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="things">
      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
Yellow.
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 5

Order the following parts of the _box model_ from **'innermost'** to
**'outermost'**.

content, border, margin, padding

<!-- your answer starts here -->
Content, padding, border, margin
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="divOne"></div>
    <div class="divTwo"></div>
    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divOne, divTwo and divThree would all be on the top 'line'.  divOne would be in
the upper right corner, divTwo would be in the upper left corner and divThree
would be tucked to the right of divTwo in the upper left corner.  divFour and
divFive would sit directly below divTwo and divThree respectively.
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 7

Consider the following media queries. How wide, in `px`, would an element
with the class `.stretch` be at a _screen width_ of 550px?

```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
It would take up 25% of its parent element.  If the parent element is as wide as
the entire screen, then it would be (550*.25 = 137.5) 138 px wide (I assume we
round up since you can't really have .5 px... or can you?).
