# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

The web is a service because information is transmitted back and forth, and
information is provided from a server. Browsers are considered clients, and they
send requests to a server via HTTP (a set of rules that tells the server what to
do in that instance). The server processes the information or request and sends
back a response. The browser then processes that response.


## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is my web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>pear</li>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>banana</li>
    </ul>
  </body>

  </footer>
</html>
