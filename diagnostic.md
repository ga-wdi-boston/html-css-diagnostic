# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

The web is a service because it is a client and server source of applications
that communicate via http. The web is a service that uses the internet so while
the server provides data, the client requests data. In other words, the web is a
service that splits the job in two parts: web servers and web browsers.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>  This is a title </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an unordered list</li>
        <li> Item 1 </li>
        <li> Item 2 </li>
        <li> Item 3 </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 3

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

```CSS
.big {
  ...
}
```

```CSS
#contentPane {
  ...
}
```

```CSS
.important.red {
  ...
}
```

```CSS
.p {
  ...
}
```


## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="things">
      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

'specialDiv' has a text color of yellow and a font-family of sans-serif.

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be

    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
