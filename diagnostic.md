# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
  ```HTML
//<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Question 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ol>
      <li>Answer 1</li>
      <li>Answer 2</li>
      <li>Answer 3</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 2

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
```CSS
.big{}
#contentPane{}
.important, .red{}
div > p {}

```
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="things">
      <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
        Blah blah blah.
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
It will be yellow and cursive.
I looked up what happens when we have conflicting styles and according to this source: http://www.school-for-champions.com/web/css_cascade_order.htm#.WIIbKLYrIcg
because inline styles are closest to the content, they take top precedence.

## Question 4

Order the following parts of the _box model_ from **'innermost'** to
**'outermost'**.

content, border, margin, padding

<!-- your answer starts here -->
content, padding, border, margin
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 5

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="divOne"></div>
    <div class="divTwo"></div>
    <div class="divThree"></div>
    <div class="divFour"></div>
    <div class="divFive"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divOne will be to to the right at the top of the page, because it floats right, the rest will stack on top of each other to the left, except for .divFour, which will skip to the next line, because it clears left and noq does not allow anything to float on its left.
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following media queries. How wide, in `px`, would an element
with the class `.stretch` be at a _screen width_ of 550px?

```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
It would stretch to 125px, because 25px is 25% of 100 and a screen size of 550px would be greater than 400 and less than 800, so the rules of the first media query would apply.

I may be wrong in that the percentage means of the width of the window, so it may be just 100px, because that is 25% of the 400px window itself. I tried to look that up, but ran out of time.
