# HTML & CSS Diagnostic

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text,
and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS
code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

## For HTML

    ```HTML
    <html>
    ...
    </html>
    ```

## For CSS

    ```CSS
    ul {
      ...
    }
    ```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get
everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!

## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the
interaction in terms of clients and servers.

<!-- your answer starts here -->

Clients are usually browsers but they can be mobile phones or tablets, that send a request to the
servers. Once servers receive a request, they run methods(programs) that they are asked to run to be able
to perform the requests, and once the request is ready to be deployed, they send it back to the client via HTTP
protocols.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the
format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head
and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
     <body>
     </body>
</html>
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

How would we reference each of the following categories of elements?

-   All elements that belong to the _class_ `big`
-   The element matching _ID_ `contentPane`
-   Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` _classes_
-   All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

<!-- your answer starts here -->
- .big {
  ...
}

- #contentPane {
  ...
}

- .important, .red {
  ...
}

- div > p {
  ...
}

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values
will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/main.css">
</head>
  <div class="things">
    <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
      Blah blah blah.
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```

**main.css**

```CSS
* {
  color: black;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.specialDiv {
  color: yellow;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
.things {
  font-family: arial;
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->

- font-size: 16px;
- font-family: cursive;

**'outermost'**.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
content, padding, border, margin
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger
than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be
arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="divOne"></div>
  <div class="divTwo"></div>
  <div class="divThree"></div>
  <div class="divFour"></div>
  <div class="divFive"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```CSS
div {
  /* ... */
  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */
  /* ... */
  float: left;
}

.divOne {
  float: right;
}

.divFour {
  clear: left;
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
divFour will be cleared from elements that are floated to the left, so 
it will go under elements that are floated to the left and take as much space as is needed.

divOne will be floated to the right while all other div tags will be floated to the left.

<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 7

Consider the following media queries. How wide, in `px`, would an element
with the class `.stretch` be at a _screen width_ of 550px?

```CSS
.stretch {
  width: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 400px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 25%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .stretch {
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```

<!-- your answer starts here -->
Width for 550px screen will be 34.38% which is 34.38px in px.
