## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the interaction in terms of clients and servers.
<!-- your answer starts here -->
It is a service in that it is the medium in which clients and servers interact and it fascilitates that interaction.  Clients send requests to servers which are processed by the server and then returned to the client in the form of a response that is composed of the material the client originally requested.
