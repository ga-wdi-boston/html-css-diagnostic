## Question 1

When we say that the web is a service, what does that mean? Explain the interaction in terms of clients and servers.

It is a request/response mechanism.  The cleint makes a request from the server and the server replies with a response.

## Question 2

Between the comments below, write HTML to create a basic web page (using the format described in the instructions). The page should have a title in the head and an unordered list (with three items) inside the body.
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
     <title>Title goes here</title>
    </head>
      <body>
      <ul>
        <li>list item1</li>
        <li>list item2</li>
        <li>list item3</li>
      </ul>
      </body>
    </html>

## Question 3

What selectors could we write to reference each of the following categories of elements?
* All elements that belong to the class `big`
* The element matching ID `contentPane`
* Only those elements belonging to both the `important` and `red` classes
* All `p` elements whose parent elements are `div`s

.big {}
#contentPane{}
.import.red{}
.div > p{}

## Question 4

Consider the following HTML and CSS code. What text color and font-family values will the div labeled 'specialDiv' have?

</head>
  <div class="things">
    <div class="specialDiv" style="font-family: cursive">
      Blah blah blah.
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```

**main.css**
```CSS

## Question 6

Consider the following HTML and CSS. Assuming that the window is much larger than the dimensions of any of the `div`s given below, how will each `div` be arranged on the page?

**index.html**

```HTML

  <div class="divTwo"></div>
  <div class="divThree"></div>
  <div class="divFour"></div>

  /* Some other specifications, e.g. dimensions. */

.divOne {

divFour will float left below the other divThree

## Question 7
